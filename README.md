Caterpillar CMS for GAE/Go

## Classic App Engine

This package has recently been converted to use [`context.Context`](http://godoc.org/golang.org/x/net/context) instead of [`appengine.Context`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/go/reference#Context). The [classic branch](https://github.com/knightso/caterpillar/tree/classic) has an old version that uses `appengine.Context`.
